## Background
Data becomes more powerful when you share it with others! That’s because people can use your data only if they can access it. So, you’ll use HTML and CSS to create a dashboard featuring the Latitude vs. X analysis of weather.

## Website Requirements
The overall requirements for your website are as follows:

Your website must consist of seven pages as follows:

### A landing page that contains the following elements:

An explanation of the project.

A link to each visualization page. For these, a sidebar should contain a preview image of each visualization. Clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.

### Four visualization pages, stored in the visualizations folder, each with the following elements:

A descriptive title and a heading tag.

The visualization for the selected comparison (latitude vs. max temperature, latitude vs. humidity, latitude vs. cloudiness, or latitude vs. wind speed). The images that these pages display should be stored in the assets/images folder.

A paragraph describing the visualization and its significance.

### A comparisons page that does the following:

Contains all the visualizations on the same page so that people can easily compare them.

Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations. This grid must contain two visualizations across a medium or large screen and one visualization across an extra-small or small screen.

### A data page that displays a responsive table containing the data that the visualizations use, as follows:

The table must be a Bootstrap table component.
The data must come from either exporting or converting the CSV file to HTML. To do so, try using a tool that you already know: Pandas.
